  - title: Good schematic checklist
    list: [
      Separate double wire junctions,
      Use dots for wire junctions, not crosses,
      Make symbols for similar devices consistent E.g. resistors,
      Name every part with a unique designator,
      Align wires and components horizontally or vertically,
      "Label pin numbers on the outside of a symbol, signal names on the inside",
      "Place text orientation consistently E.g. horizontal",
      Place components from left to right with a local flow,
      Put higher voltage towards the top,
      Put positive voltages <code>Vcc</code> up and negative voltages <code>GND</code> down,
      Separate schematic into logical blocks,
      Make the schematic fit in <code>A4</code> or </code>A3</code> standard sized papers,
      Place decoupling capacitors next to their devices,
      Keep names reasonably short,
      Use uppercase symbol names
